# Chicago Serie

Simple HomeAssistant integration providing a select entity per season of the Chicago Serie coming from this amazing resource (https://petitcartonvert.tumblr.com/post/158289265736/chicago-franchise-episodes-timeline).

## Installation
There are two options, either add this repository as repository to HACS and search for "Chicago" or clone/ download this repo and copy the custom_components/chicago folder. Restart your Home Assistant afterwards.

## Adding
The integration can only be setup through the UI
1. Go to settings
2. Open the Devices and Services section
3. Click on Add Integration
4. Search for Chicago
5. Enter a name (can be helpfull if you want to run multiple)
6. Select the season you want


## Side notes
The list is splitted per season to keep the list relatively short and therefore HA fast.
